# unison-fsmonitor for Python 3

This is a fork of [Hannes Landeholmâ€™s Unison OS X unison-fsmonitor adapter](https://github.com/hnsl/unox) that works with Python 3.

It has been tested to work successfully with Unison 2.51.2 (the latest public release as of July 2018) and Python 3.6.5 on macOS Sierra 10.12.6.
